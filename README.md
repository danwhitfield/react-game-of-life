# Example of Conway's Game of Life using React
I just wanted to play with React and [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) seemed like an interesting way to do that.

## Install and run

```
git clone https://github.com/danwhitfield/react-game-of-life.git
cd react-game-of-life
npm install
npm start
```

## Usage
Just click on the cells in the grid to make them alive, then you can either step though each each generation with the 'Next' button, or you can hit start to run the generations automatically.
